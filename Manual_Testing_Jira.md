<h3>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</h3>
(inserati aici motivul pentru care a fost facuta etapa de monitorizare si control si respectiv cum s-a facut aceasta etapa. Aici veti insera de asemenea si raportul de status (test status report) din zephyr - test metrics - primul din lista care sa reflecte activitatea si evolutia testarii. Recomand aici sa executati teste aproape in fiecare zi ca sa vada angajatorul implicarea voastra in testare)
